# FlickrImageSearchApp

## Objective:
Build a basic image search app that allows the user to search and view images from Flickr API.

## Things covered:
* On launch, users will be taken to a home screen that automatically displays geographically- relevant results based on their current location.
* Users are able to supply a search term to receive results related to that search term.
* The app can asynchronously present the results as thumbnails on a grid.
* The images are cached properly.
* The user is able to tap on a thumbnail to view the image in its entirety, metadata displayed on-screen (e.g., image name, size, resolution, date,
etc.).
* There are few unit tests to cover the core functionality of the app.

## Future objective:
* Add pagination to load more images as scroll reaches to end of the List.
* Add animations while displaying images.
* Add attractive icons and improve UI to enrich the look and feel of the app.
* Use Navigation coordinator to manage routing between screens.
* Implement UI Tests
